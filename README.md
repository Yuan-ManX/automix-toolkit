Models and datasets for training deep learning automatic mixing models

python -m venv env 
source env/bin/activate

pip install -e .

Eventually we want `pip install automix`

Download the demo dataset

Right now we could build a demo dataset using some creative commons mixes
http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/multitrack/MixEvaluation/
Or we could build our own dataset using loops from Logic
